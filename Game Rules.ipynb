    "# Game Description\n",
    "Analog Tactics is a skirmish game where each player controls a group of units on a hexagonal grid. By securing objectives and eliminating enemy units, you gain victory points (VP). You win the game by being the first to gain 50 victory points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlling Units is easy and intuitive. Units have points that they can use to move, attack, or use abilities. If you want to do something, just spend an appropriate attribute point and do that action. For instance, use an Attack point to attack, a Movement point to move, or a Special point to use an ability. Units also have attributes that tell you how much damage they do, how much health they have, and how easy it is to hit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game focuses on a deep upgrade system unique to each class of units, where complexity and strategy comes mostly from how you upgrade and use your units over the course of the game. Each turn your units will level up to give you an opportunity to add a new ability through their pool of available abilities. Additionally, each class has a separate upgrade system dependent on your decisions throughout the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use abilities and tactics to maximize the number of points you earn each round by either eliminating other players' units or capturing objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Game Flow Overview\n",
    "Each round consists of each player taking their turn. During their turn, a player's units will all be placed on the game board with full health and attributes, allowing them to move, attack, and function in general to their fullest potential. Each player will spend their turn maneuvering their units to capture objectives and attacking their opponent's units to gain points and bonuses. After each person has taken a turn, the round ends and each player levels up their units by choosing new available abilities. Continue to gain points until the victory threshold has been reached."

    "- Unit attacks are resolved using D6 dice: the initiator's dice result plus their passive hit modifier compares to the target's dice result plus the target's passive evasion modifier. An attack always deals base damage. If the overall hit result is greater than the overall evasion result, the attack adds Critical Damage. \n",
    "- Damage is calculated from the attacker's total 'Damage' output minus the target's 'Armor' attribute. Resulting Damage is subtracted from the target's Health attribute. A unit that reaches zero health is removed from the board.\n",
    "- Some abilities cost 'Special' points. Units have a certain number of Special points each round to spend on abilities\n",
    "- Between player turns, players may use abilities that cost 'Reaction' points.\n",
    "- All used points refresh to their maximum at the beginning of a player's turn.\n",
    "- Units that have been eliminated respawn on the board at the beginning of a player's turn.\n",
    "- Units use Line of Sight to find targets for ranged attacks.\n",
    "- Objectives are captured by players and have a Health attribute. 'Decapturing' an objective means reducing the objective's health to zero. The objective then becomes neutral and may be captured by any other player.\n",
    "- After each player has taken a turn, the round ends and each player levels up."

    "- Each player begins the game controlling 1 objective\n",
    "- Objectives have 10 Health. To decapture an objective, reduce its health to zero. The objective becomes neutral.\n",
    "- Objectives have 1 Armor per adjacent friendly unit, and is immune to [Piercing](#Piercing)\n",
    "- To capture a neutral objective, spend a point specified by your class.\n",
    "- At the end of your turn, score VP equal to the number of objectives you control\n",
    "- Objectives occupy spaces, so units normally cannot move through them\n",
    "\n",
    "## Respawn Points\n",
    "- Respawn Points are separate objects on the board that allow you to respawn units\n",
    "- Capture a Respawn Point using an attribute point detailed by your class\n",
    "- Respawn Points have no Health and can be freely captured by opposing players\n",

    "## Your Turn\n",
    "- At the beginning of your turn, respawn all units next to a respawn or objective you own unless otherwise noted in your class\n",
    "- You may use points from any unit in any order to move, attack, and use abilities.\n",
    "- Each ability has a keyword at the end of it, showing what type of attribute point is used to use that ability. \n",
    "- Abilities with the ‘Passive’ keyword requires no points and is always active\n",
    "- Abilities with the ‘Reaction’ keyword may be used during any player’s turn when the conditions of the ability are met\n",
    "- If an ability can be used as either a Special or Reaction, a slash will be used at the end of the description (ex ‘Special/ Reaction’)\n",
    "- If an ability costs more than one point, a plus sign will be used to indicate the combined points cost (ex. Attack + Special)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leveling Up\n",
    "- Every round, automatically level up at the end of the round\n",
    "- When you level up, you may pick any ability within the current ability tier list or any previous tier (Tier lists are labeled with abilities). For example, if tier 3 is level 8+ and you have just turned level 8, you may choose abilities from tier 3, tier 2, or tier 1.\n",
    "- Leveling is different for each class; check class rules to determine what abilities you have access to\n",
    "- Additionally, your stats increase per level, allowing you to do more things during your turn, increase your durability, or increase your damage output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaining Victory Points\n",
    "- Gain 2VP per objective you control at the end of your turn\n",
    "- Gain 1VP by eliminating an enemy Common\n",
    "- Gain 3VP by eliminating an enemy Elite\n",

    "- All ranged Attacks (Range 2+) do not deal base damage unless otherwise stated\n",
    "- Attack points are refreshed every round\n",
    "- You may target enemy units within [Line of Sight](#Line of Sight). For range 1 attacks (1 space away) you may target units in the front 3 spaces (1,2,6). If you wish to target units outside of these spaces, you must use Movement/Reaction points to either change direction or move towards the enemy unit.\n",

    "- Reactions may be used whenever the conditions described by the reaction ability are met\n",
    "- If no specific conditions are described in the ability, you can use that Reaction any time\n",
    "- In general, Reactions can be used after (or sometimes before) a 'step' in the game has occurred. A 'step' includes taking any action by using a point, evaluating the effect of using a point, taking damage, losing Health, declaring an attack, etc.\n",
    "- The same Reaction ability cannot be used multiple times per combat interaction\n",
    "- Reaction points refresh after each round\n",
    "- If multiple players want to react to the same game step, the unit with the highest evasion takes precedence. To further break ties, go in order of players starting with the current player's turn. (Example: Player 3's turn, Player 1 and 4 want to react but need a tie break. Player 4 will go next sooner than Player 1, and therefore reacts first).\n",

    "- Base Evasion and Hit modifiers are constant attributes\n",
    "- If an ability defines the Hit of an attack (ex. 6 Hit), the targeted unit rolls Evasion against that value and the initiator of the attack does not roll or add modifiers. Similarly, if an ability defines evasion (ex. 6 Evasion), the unit initiating the attack rolls Hit against that value and the defending unit does not roll Evasion.\n",

Because B is in unit A’s #2 space, it is within line of sight and can therefore be targeted. Unit B is facing southeast, has an Evasion modifier of 2, has 1 Armor, and 1 Health left. Because unit B does not have line of sight of unit A, unit B must take 3 by default. Unit A needs to succeed on a Critical Roll to eliminate the target, since the base damage and armor would cancel out. Unit A rolls a 4 for Hit. Adding Hit and Evasion modifiers respectively, Hit and Evasion are both 5, and ties go to the defender. Unit A deals 1 damage, minus 1 armor from Unit B. No Health changes happen to B, and A has 1 less Attack point. Unit A attacks again. This time player A rolls a 5. Adding modifiers, 6 Hit is greater than 5 Evasion. Unit B subtracts 2 damage – 1 armor from its Health. Unit B is at 0 health and is eliminated and removed from the board. Player A gains VP for eliminating the target.
