    "# Game Description\n",
    "Analog Tactics is a skirmish game where each player controls a group of five units on a hexagonal grid. By securing objectives and eliminating enemy units, you gain victory points (VP) and experience points (XP) to level up your own units. You win the game by being the first to gain 30 victory points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlling Units is easy and intuitive. Units have points that they can use to move, attack, or use abilities. If you want to do something, just use a point and do the thing. Units also have attributes that tell you how much damage they do, how much health they have, and how easy it is to hit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game focuses on a deep upgrade system unique to each class of units, where complexity and strategy comes mostly from how you upgrade and use your units over the course of the game."

    "\n",
    "## Units and Classes\n",
    "- A player chooses a base class at the beginnning of the game: Warrior, Assassin, Mage, Engineer\n",
    "- Each player controls their team of units, consisting of 1 Elite unit and 4 Common units\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Board\n",
    "- The game board consists of hexagonal spaces\n",
    "- Each hexagonal space is referred to as a ‘space’ in relevant abilities\n",
    "- Respawn points are separately placed and should include the same number as the number of objectives\n",
    "- The number of permanent [obstacles](#Obstacles) are determined by the players based on how populated you want the map to be\n",
    "- On the sample board, blue spaces designate objectives, and green spaces designate respawn points, and black spaces designate permanent Obstacles. Objective and obstacle placements can change to suit players’ preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Standard Template](Template.PNG)\n",
    "![Sample Board](Sample Board.PNG)\n",
    "- A sample board for 3 players\n",
    "![Sample Obstacles](Sample Obstacles.PNG)\n",
    "- Sample board with sample obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Flow\n",
    "- The game consists of round and turns.\n",
    "- A round begins before the first player takes their turn. Use the time before the first player takes their turn to decide unit upgrades and note refreshed unit points\n",
    "- At the beginning of a round, all units refresh their expendable attribute points\n",
    "- Units respawn at the beginning of that player’s turn unless stated otherwise\n",
    "- Any dice rolls use a six-sided die, and are referred to as a D6\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Objectives are crucial to winning the game, as these are the primary way to gain VP\n",
    "- Additionally, spaces immediately surrounding an objective function as a respawn area\n",
    "- Each player begins the game controlling 1 objective\n",
    "- Objectives have 10 Health. To decapture an objective, reduce its health to zero. The objective becomes neutral.\n",
    "- Decapturing an Objective gives 1XP\n",
    "- Objectives have 1 Armor per adjacent friendly unit, and is immune to [Piercing](#Piercing)\n",
    "- To capture a neutral objective, spend a point specified by your class within Range 1 of the objective.\n",
    "- At the end of your turn, score VP equal to the number of objectives you control\n",
    "- Units cannot move through Objectives\n",
    "- At the end of the round, if there are no enemy units next to an Objective you own, recover one Health to that Objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Respawn Points\n",
    "- Respawn Points act as areas that you can place respawning units\n",
    "- Capture a Respawn Point using an attribute point detailed by your class\n",
    "- Respawn Points have no Health and can be freely captured by opposing players\n",
    "- Units cannot move through Respawn Points\n",
    "- You may move units freely between points adjacent to any Respawn Point you possess\n",
    "\n",
    "[Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)\n",

    "## Obstacles\n",
    "- Obstacles are stationary units that occupy 1 space\n",
    "- By default Obstacles have 2 Armor and 1 Health\n",
    "- Obstacles are immune to [Piercing](#Piercing)\n",
    "- Permanent Obstacles cannot be removed from the game board\n",

    "# Core Game Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Beginning A Game\n",
    "- All players roll a D6. The highest player goes first, and all other players’ turns ordered by their rolls. If there is a tie, reroll until there is a winner.\n",
    "- Take turns placing objective, permanent obstacle locations, and permanent respawn points\n",
    "- The number of objectives in a game is 2x the number of players plus 1 (2P+1). \n",
    "- Take turns choosing a starting objective owned by each player.\n",
    "- Place starting units within your respawn area or within 1 space of your starting objective\n",
    "- Your units start the game with all abilities described in their class's tier 0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start of Round\n",
    "- Before the round starts, you upgrade your character according to its level. Note all refreshed points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Turn\n",
    "- At the beginning of your turn, respawn all units next to a respawn or objective you own unless otherwise noted in your class\n",
    "- You may use points from any unit in any order to move, attack, and use abilities.\n",
    "- Each ability has a keyword at the end of it, showing what type of attribute point is used to use that ability. \n",
    "- Abilities with the ‘Passive’ keyword requires no points and is always active\n",
    "- Abilities with the ‘Reaction’ keyword may be used during any player’s turn when the conditions of the ability are met\n",
    "- If an ability can be used as either a Special or Reaction, a comma will be used at the end of the description (ex ‘Special, Reaction’)\n",
    "- If an ability costs two points, a plus sign will be used (ex. Attack + Special)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leveling Up\n",
    "- Every time your unit eliminates an enemy unit, you gain 1XP\n",
    "- When you gain 1 XP, you level up at the end of the round. Leveling up is detailed by your specific class. \n",
    "- When you level up, you may pick any ability within the current ability tier list or any previous tier (Tier lists are labeled with abilities). For example, if tier 3 is level 8+ and you have just turned level 8, you may choose abilities from tier 3, tier 2, or tier 1.\n",
    "- Leveling is different for each class; check class rules to determine what abilities you get\n",
    "- Additionally, your stats increase per level, allowing you to do more things during your turn, increase your durability, or increase your damage output.\n",
    "- You may only level up twice per turn. Any additional XP is converted to VP at a 1:1 ratio (1XP:1VP)\n",
    "- After reaching level 10, any XP is converted to VP at a 1:1 ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Leveling\n",
    "- At the end of the round, if you are below level 5 and did not gain XP this round, gain 1XP\n",
    "- If you are below level 5 and did gain XP this round, gain 1VP\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaining Victory Points\n",
    "- Gain 1VP per objective you control at the end of your turn\n",
    "- Gain 1VP by eliminating an enemy elite\n",
    "- Gain VP by gaining additional XP past the requirements to level up twice during a single turn at a 1:1 ratio (1XP:1VP)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Winning the Game\n",
    "- Obtain 30VP to end the game\n",
    "- If a player reaches 30VP, finish out the round. The player who has the most VP over 30 wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaining Experience Points\n",
    "- Gain 1XP to level up your units by 1\n",
    "- Gain 1XP per enemy unit you eliminate\n",
    "- Gain 1XP per Objective you decapture\n",
    "\n",

    "## Your Units\n",
    "- Each unit is defined by its attributes and the values associated with its attributes\n",
    "- A player takes their turn, using their units’ points to move, attack, and use abilities until they cannot do anything else, or voluntarily end their turn\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Expendable Attribute: Attack, Movement, Special, Reaction\n",
    "- Expendable attributes decrease every time you use an action of that attribute type\n",
    "- At the beginning of the round, all expendable attributes are refreshed\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constant Attributes: Damage, Armor, Evasion, Hit\n",
    "- Constant attributes determine results of interactions and do not change when used\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Attributes\n",
    "- Health (HP) – When total damage taken reaches this number, your unit is eliminated\n",
    "- Attack – Use 1 Attack point to deal damage equal to your Damage attribute\n",
    "- Movement – Move a unit 1 space per point\n",
    "- Special – Points used for Special abilities\n",
    "- Reaction – Points used for Reaction abilities\n",
    "- Damage – Amount of Health taken away from 1 standard Attack\n",
    "- Armor – Subtract this number from an enemy attack’s Damage\n",
    "- Evasion – Modifier added to any Evasion rolls\n",
    "- Hit – Modifier added to any Hit rolls\n",
    "\n",
    "## Health\n",
    "- Health is subtracted whenever your unit is [damaged](#Damage)\n",
    "- When Health reaches 0 the affected unit is removed from play and 'Eliminated'\n",
    "- If a unit is Eliminated, remove it from the board\n",
    "- Health does not refresh across rounds unless stated otherwise\n",
    "- Leveling up affects the maximum Health of a unit automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attack\n",
    "- All initiated Attacks are Range 1 (melee) unless otherwise stated\n",
    "- Attack points are refreshed every round\n",
    "- You may target enemy units within [Line of Sight](#Line of Sight). For range 1 attacks (1 space away) you may target units in the front 3 spaces (1,2,6). If you wish to target units outside of these spaces, you must use Movement/Reaction points to either change direction or move towards the enemy unit.\n",
    "- Abilities may use 'Attack' as a keyword. If 'Attack' is mentioned in the ability, it is implied that an Evasion and Hit roll determines success of the attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Movement\n",
    "- Expend a Movement point to move a unit and/or change its Direction\n",
    "- Movement points refresh after every round\n",
    "- Any spaces with a unit in it is considered occupied\n",
    "- Units cannot move through occupied spaces unless otherwise noted\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample Movement](Figure3.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Orientation\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![Orientation](Figure2.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Movement: \n",
    "Unit U starts at position U with 2 movement points. U moves to U’ and spends 1 movement point, and has 1 left. U moves from U’ to U’’, spending the last movement point. U can no longer move because it has 0 movement points remaining. The unit will be able to move again next turn after refreshing its Movement points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special\n",
    "- Expend a Special point when using an ability with a Special cost\n",
    "- Special points refresh after each round\n",
    "- Some abilites are described as being an 'Attack'. Abilities that are 'Attacks' use attacking mechanics and may be reacted to as Attacks\n",
    "- Some abilities cost a Special point and are described with 'on successful attack'. After the attack is resolved (determining Hit and Evasion), you may use the ability to modify your attack and apply its effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reaction\n",
    "- Expend a Reaction point to use a Reaction ability\n",
    "- Reactions may be used whenever the conditions described by the reaction ability are met\n",
    "- If no specific conditions are described in the ability, you can use that Reaction any time\n",
    "- In general, Reactions can be used after (or sometimes before) a 'step' in the game has occurred. A 'step' includes taking any action by using a point, evaluating the effect of using of a point, taking damage, losing Health, etc.\n",
    "- Reaction abilities cannot be used multiple times per combat interaction\n",
    "- Reaction points refresh after each round\n",
    "- Reactions cannot be taken after your unit is Eliminated\n",
    "\n",
    "## Damage\n",
    "- Damage is the value associated with an initiated base attack\n",
    "- Damage stays constant across rounds and is subject to change from leveling up or abilities\n",
    "- Certain abilities use a predetermined damage amount instead of your damage attribute\n",
    "- 'Losing Heath' is different than 'Taking Damage', as incoming damage is considered the precursor to losing health (after Armor/Reaction effects are considered).\n",
    "- Dealing damage is not synonymous with a successful attack\n",
    "\n",
    "### Targeted Damage\n",
    "- Damage that targets a unit is considered Targeted Damage\n",
    "- Damage that selects spaces is not considered Targeted Damage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Armor\n",
    "- If a unit is damaged during an attack, take the incoming damage of the attacking unit and subtract the targeted unit's Armor value. This value is subtracted from the targeted unit’s Health.\n",
    "- Armor stays constant across rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evasion and Hit Modifier\n",
    "- When initiating an attack or attacking ability, the initiating unit rolls a D6 ('rolling Hit'), then adds their Hit modifier. The targeted unit rolls a D6 ('rolling Evasion'), then adds their Evasion modifier. \n",
    "- If the initiating unit rolls higher, the attack is a success and damage is calculated and subtracted from the current health value of the targeted unit. \n",
    "- If the targeted unit rolls higher, the attack misses and no health is subtracted\n",
    "- Ties go to the targeted unit, unless otherwise noted (rolling the same number results in an evasion)\n",
    "- Base Evasion and Hit modifiers are constant attributes\n",
    "- If an ability defines the Hit of an attack (ex. 6 Hit), the targeted unit rolls Evasion against that value and the initiator of the attack does not roll or add modifiers. Similarly, if an ability defines evasion (ex. 6 Evasion), the unit initiating the attack rolls Hit against that value and the defending unit does not roll Evasion.\n",

Because B is in unit A’s #2 space, it is within line of sight and can therefore be targeted. Unit B is facing southeast, has an Evasion modifier of 2, has 1 Armor, and 1 Health left. Because unit B does not have line of sight of unit A, unit A has +1 Hit to its Hit roll. Both players roll a D6. Unit A rolls a 3, and unit B rolls a 2. Adding Hit and Evasion modifiers respectively, Hit and Evasion are both 4, and ties go to the defender. No changes happen to B, and A has 1 less Attack point. Unit A attacks again. This time player A rolls a 5, and player B rolls a 2. Adding modifiers, 6 Hit is greater than 4 Evasion. Unit B subtracts 2 damage – 1 armor from its Health. Unit B is at 0 health and is eliminated and removed from the board. Player A gains XP and VP if applicable. "

    "The Mage is a highly flexible class that is based on using Special points to deal ranged damage. The capabilities and utility of your units depend on which Elements you attune throughout the game. The upgrade system is turn based, increasing your Elemental use the more you attune them. \n",

    "- Default cast range is 3 spaces, meaning you can use abilities targeting units within 3 spaces. Your Elite default Attack also uses cast range.\n",
    "- Keyword: Cooldown: This ability can only be used once per turn.\n",
    "- Every round at the beginning of your turn, choose one Element to attune. This increases the Attunement of that Element and gives you access to all abilities up to your current level. \n",

    "- For example, if your Air Attunement is 2, you have access to 2 Air abilities of your choice when attuned to an element different than Air. Access to abilities is also limited by your current level.\n",

    "- You always have access to Tier 0 abilities, regardless of which element you are attuned to\n",
    "- At the end of the round when you gain levels, your Commons gain stat bonuses according to the new level and Element you are attuned to. If you gain two levels, gain stats for both levels in the current element\n",
    "- For example, let's say you are currently level 4 and level up to 5 at the end of the round. If you attuned Fire during your turn, you gain the lvl 5 stat bonus: in this case Movement +1. If you gained 2 levels, you would get both upgrades for lvl 5 and 6 in Fire.\n",
