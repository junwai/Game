    "# Overview\n",
    "Analog Tactics is a game where each player controls a group of units. By securing objectives and eliminating enemy units, you gain victory points (VP) and experience points (XP) to level up your units. You win the game by being the first to gain 15 victory points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Units and Classes\n",
    "- A player chooses a base class at the beginnning of the game: Knight, Assassin, Mage, Engineer\n",
    "- Each player controls their team of units, consisting of 1 Elite unit and base 4 Common units\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Board\n",
    "- The game board consists of hexagonal spaces. \n",
    "- Each hexagonal space is referred to as a ‘space’ in relevant abilities\n",
    "- On the sample board, red spaces designate objectives, and blue spaces designate permanent obstacles. Objective and obstacle placements can change to suit players’ preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample Board](Figure1.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Units (U) have orientations depicted with an arrow. The front space is ‘1’, moving clockwise increasing to ‘6’\n",
    "\n",
    "![Orientation](Figure2.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "- The game consists of round and turns.\n",
    "- A round begins before the first player takes their turn. Use the time before the first player takes their turn to decide unit upgrades and note refreshed points\n",
    "- At the beginning of a round, all units refresh their expendable attribute points\n",
    "- Units respawn at the beginning of that player’s turn unless stated otherwise\n",
    "- Any dice rolls use a six-sided die, and are referred to as a D6\n",
    "\n",
    "## Respawning Units\n",
    "- At the beginning of your turn, you may respawn a unit within your designated respawn area or within 1 space of an objective you control.\n",
    "- You may also respawn units based on each class's own respawn rules\n",
    "\n",
    "[Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Units\n",
    "- Each unit is defined by its attributes and the values associated with its attributes\n",
    "- A player takes their turn, using their units’ points to move, attack, and use abilities until they cannot do anything else, or voluntarily ends their turn\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Expendable Attribute: Attack, Movement, Special, Reaction\n",
    "- Expendable attributes decrease every time you use an action of that attribute type\n",
    "- At the beginning of the round, all expendable attributes are refreshed\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constant Attributes: Damage, Armor, Evasion, Hit\n",
    "- Constant attributes do not change when used\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Attributes\n",
    "- Health (HP) – If this number reaches 0, your unit is eliminated\n",
    "- Attack – Use 1 attack point to deal damage equal to your damage attribute\n",
    "- Movement – Move a unit 1 space per point\n",
    "- Special – Points used for special abilities\n",
    "- Reaction – Points used for reaction abilities\n",
    "- Damage – Amount of health taken away from 1 standard attack\n",
    "- Armor – Subtract this number from an enemy attack’s damage\n",
    "- Evasion – Modifier added to any evasion rolls\n",
    "- Hit – Modifier added to any attack rolls\n",
    "\n",
    "## Health\n",
    "- Health is subtracted whenever your unit is [damaged](#Damage)\n",
    "- When health reaches 0 the affected unit is removed from play and 'eliminated'\n",
    "- Health does not refresh across rounds unless stated otherwise\n",
    "- Levelling up affects the maximum health of a unit, but does not immediately affect a unit’s current health, i.e. if a unit currently has 5 HP and levels up, any increases to maximum health do not raise the unit’s HP from 5 to 6 at the beginning of the next round\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attack\n",
    "- All initiated attacks are range 1 unless otherwise stated\n",
    "- Attack points are refreshed every round\n",
    "- You may target enemy units within line of sight. This means for range 1 attacks (1 space away) you may target units in the front 3 spaces (1,2,6). If you wish to target units outside of these spaces, you must use movement points to either change orientation or move towards the enemy unit.\n",
    "- Abilities may use attack as a keyword. If 'attack' is mentioned in the abilitiy, this implies an evasion and hit roll to determine success of the attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Movement\n",
    "- Expend a Movement point to move a unit and change its orientation. Both are optional.\n",
    "- Movement points refresh after every round\n",
    "- Any spaces with a unit on it is considered occupied\n",
    "- Units cannot move through occupied spaces unless otherwise noted\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample Movement](Figure3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Movement: \n",
    "Unit U starts at position U with 2 movement points. U moves to U’ and spends 1 movement point, and has 1 left. U moves from U’ to U’’, spending the last movement point. U can no longer move because it has 0 movement points remaining. The unit will be able to move again next turn after refreshing its movement points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special\n",
    "- Expend a Special point when using an ability with a Special cost\n",
    "- Special points refresh after each round\n",
    "- Some abilites are described as being an 'Attack'. Abilities that are 'Attacks' use attacking mechanics and may be reacted to as Attacks\n",
    "- Some abilities cost a Special point and are described with 'on successful attack'. After the attack is resolved (determining hit and evasion), you may use the ability to modify your attack and apply its effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reaction\n",
    "- Expend a Reaction point when using a Reaction\n",
    "- Reactions may be used whenever the conditions described by the reaction ability are met\n",
    "- In general, Reactions can be used after (or sometimes before) a 'step' in the game has occurred. A 'step' includes using taking an action by using a point, evaluating the effect of using of a point, taking damage, losing health, etc. \n",
    "- Reaction points refresh after each round\n",
    "\n",
    "## Damage\n",
    "- This is the value associated with an initiated base attack\n",
    "- Damage stays constant across rounds and is subject to change from leveling up or abilities\n",
    "- Certain abilities use a predetermined damage amount instead of your damage attribute\n",
    "- 'Losing Heath' is different than 'Taking Damage', as incoming damage is considered the precursor to losing health.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Armor\n",
    "- If a unit is damaged during an attack, take the damage attribute of the attacking unit and subtract the targeted unit's armor value. This value is subtracted from the targeted unit’s health\n",
    "- Armor stays constant across rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evasion and Hit Modifier\n",
    "- When initiating an attack or attacking ability, the initiating unit rolls a D6 (rolling hit), then adds their hit modifier. The targeted unit rolls a D6 (rolling evasion), then adds their evasion modifier. \n",
    "- If the initiating unit rolls higher, the attack is a success and damage is calculated and subtracted from the current health value of the targeted unit. \n",
    "- If the targeted unit rolls higher, the attack misses and no health is subtracted\n",
    "- Ties go to the targeted unit, unless otherwise noted\n",
    "- Base evasion and hit modifiers are constant attributes\n",
    "- If an ability defines the hit of an attack (ex. 6 hit), the targeted unit rolls evasion against that value and the initiator of the attack does not roll or add modifiers. Similarly, if an ability defines evasion (ex. 6 evasion), the unit initiating the attack rolls hit against that value and the defending unit does not roll evasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leveling Up\n",
    "- Every time your unit eliminates an enemy unit, you gain 1XP\n",
    "- When you gain enough XP (1 or 2 per level), you level up. Levelling up is detailed by your specific class. \n",
    "- When you level up, you may pick any ability within the current ability tier list or any previous tier (Tier lists are labeled with abilities). For example, if tier 3 is level 8+ and you have just turned level 8, you may choose abilities from tier 3, tier 2, or tier 1. Special class rules may override this.\n",
    "- Additionally, your stats increase per level, allowing you to do more things during your turn, increase your durability, or increase your damage output.\n",
    "- You may only level up twice per turn. Any additional XP is converted to VP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Leveling\n",
    "- At the end of the round after applying gained XP (leveling up), if you are below level 4, you automatically gain 1 level\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaining Victory Points\n",
    "- Obtain 15VP to win the game\n",
    "- Gain 1VP per objective you control at the end of your turn\n",
    "- Gain 1VP by eliminating an enemy elite\n",
    "- Gain VP by gaining additional XP past the requirements to level up twice during a single turn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combat Hierarchy\n",
    "- 1: Establish Initiating Unit and Targeted Unit. This costs Attack/Special points to initiate depending on Attack or Ability\n",
    "- 2: Initiating Unit rolls Hit, Targeted Unit rolls Evasion; Resolve. If Wounding, skip this step.\n",
    "- 3: If targeted unit is hit (initiating unit has higher value), subtract Armor from incoming Damage. If Piercing, skip this step.\n",
    "- 4: Targeted unit loses Health equal to Damage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantage and Disadvantage\n",
    "- Gaining advantage means you roll two D6 and take the higher\n",
    "- Gaining disadvantage means you roll two D6 and take the lower\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line of Sight\n",
    "- A unit's line of sight begins in spaces 1,2, and 6 and includes all spaces extending from them \n",
    "- A unit has line of sight if any corner of its occupied space can reach any corner of the targeted unit without coming in contact with another occupied space\n",
    "- If a targeted unit does not have line of sight of the initiating unit, the targeted unit has -1 Evasion on its evasion roll\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partial Line of Sight\n",
    "- Assume you have line of sight of a unit by drawing an imaginary line between the corner of your unit (Corner A) and the corner of the targeted unit (Corner B)\n",
    "- If an imaginary line from Corner A cannot also reach the two adjacent corners to Corner B, your unit has partial line of sight\n",
    "- If you target a unit within partial line of sight, you have [disadvantage](#Advantage-and-Disadvantage) on your hit roll\n",
    "\n",
    "![Line of Sight](Figure4.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ranged Attacks\n",
    "- Ranged Attacks can target units multiple spaces away. The range value determines how many spaces away units can be targeted\n",
    "- Ranged Attacks cannot target spaces out of line of sight unless otherwise noted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nondirectional\n",
    "- Line of Sight rules do not apply. Evaluate a normal combat interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample Combat](Figure6.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Combat: \n",
    "Unit A is facing northeast and wishes to attack unit B. Unit A has 2 attack points remaining, a hit modifier of 0, and 2 damage. Because B is in unit A’s #2 space, it is within line of sight and can therefore be targeted. Unit B is facing southeast, has an evasion modifier of 2, has 1 armor, and 1 health left. Because unit A is targeting unit B from B’s #4 space, unit A gains +1 hit modifier. Both players roll a D6. Unit A rolls a 3, and unit B rolls a 2. Adding hit and evasion modifiers respectively, hit and evasion are both 4, and ties go to the defender. No changes happen to B, and A has 1 less attack point. Unit A attacks again. This time player A rolls a 5, and player B rolls a 2. Adding modifiers, 6 hit is greater than 4 evasion. Unit B subtracts 2 damage – 1 armor from its health. Unit B is at 0 health and is eliminated and removed from the board. Player A gains XP and VP if applicable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Objectives are crucial to winning the game, as these are the primary way to gain VP\n",
    "- Additionally, spaces immediately surrounding an objective function as a respawn area\n",
    "- Each player begins the game controlling 1 objective\n",
    "- Objectives have 10 Health. To decapture an objective, reduce its health to zero. The objective becomes neutral.\n",
    "- Objectives have 1 Armor per adjacent friendly unit\n",
    "- To capture a neutral objective, spend a point specified by your class.\n",
    "- At the end of your turn, score VP equal to the number of objectives you control\n",
    "\n",
    "[Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Beginning A Game\n",
    "- All players roll a D6. The highest player goes first, and all other players’ turns ordered by their rolls. If there is a tie, reroll until there is a winner.\n",
    "- Take turns placing objective and permanent obstacle locations if you want a custom board\n",
    "- Take turns choosing a starting objective and respawn area.\n",
    "- Place starting units within your respawn area or within 1 space of your starting objective\n",
    "- Your units start the game with all abilities described in their class's tier 0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start of Round\n",
    "- Before the round starts, you should upgrade your character according to its level. Note all refreshed points.\n",
    "- The turn order can change during the game. Any time a player eliminates another player's elite, the player with the eliminated elite rotates to the back of the player order\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Turn\n",
    "- At the beginning of your turn, respawn all units unless otherwise stated in the class description\n",
    "- You may use points from any unit in any order to move, attack, and use abilities.\n",
    "- Each ability has a keyword at the end of it, showing what type of attribute point is used to use that ability. \n",
    "- Abilities with the ‘Passive’ keyword requires no points and is always active\n",
    "- Abilities with the ‘Reaction’ keyword may be used during any player’s turn when the conditions of the ability are met\n",
    "- If an ability can be used as either a special or reaction, a comma will be used at the end of the description (ex ‘Special, Reaction’)\n",
    "- If an ability costs two points, a plus sign will be used (ex. Attack + Special)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obstacles\n",
    "- Obstacles are stationary pieces that occupy 1 space\n",
    "- By default Obstacles have 2 armor and 1 health\n",
    "- Obstacles are immune to [Piercing](#Piercing)\n",
    "- Invincible Obstacles cannot be removed or moved\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wounding\n",
    "- This keyword denotes damage dealt automatically with no Hit or Evasion roll\n",
    "- Wounding Damage cannot be directly reduced with reactions (some reactions may override the Wounding keyword or not reduce damage)\n",
    "- Armor is still applied when calculating reduction of health\n",
    "\n",
    "## Piercing\n",
    "- This keyword denotes damage that ignores armor\n",
    "- Does not apply to obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Swift\n",
    "- This keyword denotes attacks or damaging abilities that cost two reaction points to react to\n",
    "- This applies only to reactions that would avoid or reduce incoming damage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Area of Effect (AOE)\n",
    "- Abilities denoted with AOE deal damage to all surrounding spaces (1-6) from the target space\n",
    "- By default AOE damage can affect friendly units, although abilities may not affect friendly units if specified\n",

    "- Purposeful Dodge: Your unit may gain and use 1 Movement point if it evades an Attack by 3 or more. Passive\n",

    "- Commons respawn automatically at the beginning of your turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Weapon](#Weapons): You may declare a weapon to be used with an attack. A Weapon acts as an attack modifier and requires no additional points. Only one weapon at a time can be used with an attack point. \n",
    "- Weaponform: Each Attack begins at weaponform 1. Each attack with a weapon during your turn increases your weaponform by 1. Maximum weaponform is 4. You may use different weapons for each weaponform number. \n",
    "- Each weapon has a corresponding ability with the unit's current weaponform number. You must use the ability corresponding with your Weaponform number. For example, if your weaponform is currently 2, you may not use any form 1’s or form 3’s, etc.\n",
    "- If you chose to not use a weapon, evaluate a standard Attack and your weaponform does not increase.\n",
    "- Eliminating an enemy unit upgrades the weapon used to eliminate that unit. For example, a unit uses Warhammer when attacking to eliminate an enemy unit. The unit's Warhammer becomes Warhammer+1, and gains the upgrade associated with Warhammer+1. Weapons upgraded this way is unit specific (i.e. Warhammer+1 only applies to the specific unit that eliminated an enemy with Warhammer). This allows your units to upgrade different weapons and specialize with different abilities and builds.\n",
    "- Decapturing an [Objective](#Objectives) upgrades the weapon used\n",
    "- Reactions gained by upgrading weapons may only be used if you last used that weapon with that unit. For example, assume your unit has Reaction abilities associated with Spear and Katana. If your unit used the Spear last, you may use Reactions given by your Spear upgrades, but not from your Katana upgrades.\n",
    "- Abilities with the weapon named in front of it (i.e. Spear: Ability. Special) can only be used with the corresponding Weapon\n",
    "- If there is no Weapon specifier in front of the upgrade, the upgrade applies in general, not only when using those Weapons. For example, gaining +2 hit passive from Rapier+3 applies to all attacks from all weapons.\n",
